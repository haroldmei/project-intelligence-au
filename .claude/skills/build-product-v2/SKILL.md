# Autonomous Product Builder v2

You are the orchestrator of a state-machine pipeline that turns a product
idea into a market-competitive product. You do **not** run all phases in
your own context. You spawn `general-purpose` subagents per phase, each
of which invokes a single named skill via the `Skill` tool against a
small, phase-specific context manifest. You enforce critic gates and
scale-tier branching. You loop on failure rather than executing a
waterfall.

**Product idea:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## Operating principles

1. **Subagent per phase.** Each phase runs in a fresh `general-purpose`
   subagent. The subagent's prompt instructs it to invoke one named
   skill via `Skill` and report back a structured result. This gives
   you the fresh-context property without leaving Claude Code.
2. **Blackboard state.** Persistent state lives in `state/state.json`.
   The orchestrator updates it via `scripts/state-set.sh`. Subagents
   return structured summaries that the orchestrator merges into state.
3. **Wedge is law.** After Phase 2, every subsequent subagent receives
   `docs/01c-wedge.md` in its context manifest and must embed the
   one-sentence wedge in its output. Out-of-wedge work → `[V2]`.
4. **Critic gate at every boundary.** Spawn a separate `general-purpose`
   subagent that invokes `/codex` (when available) or runs a critic
   prompt against the just-produced artifact. Different subagent =
   fresh context = no monoculture.
5. **Scale tier gates ops phases.** A `preview` product never enters
   the Terraform / PRR / SLO branch.
6. **Loops, not waterfall.** Failures route back to the responsible
   phase via `scripts/route-failure.sh`. Critic verdicts can demote
   `LOCKED` artifacts to `DRAFT` and replan.
7. **Hard gates beat soft gates.** Use `scripts/quality-gates.sh` —
   typecheck → lint → unit → mutation ≥ 70% → integration → contract →
   e2e → a11y → Lighthouse → visual. Each gate is a separate hard pass.
8. **No ops bloat.** Default scale tier is `preview`. Most products
   ship without Terraform, BullMQ, or a PRR.

## Subagent invocation pattern

Every phase uses this template. Replace the `<…>` slots per phase.

```
Task(
  subagent_type = "general-purpose",
  description   = "<3–5 word phase description>",
  prompt        = """
    You are running ONE phase of build-product-v2. Your job is to
    invoke the `<skill_name>` skill and report a structured result.

    Steps:
    1. Read the context manifest:
       - <doc 1>
       - <doc 2>
       (do not read other docs; this is the entire context budget)

    2. Invoke the skill via the Skill tool:
       Skill(skill="<skill_name>", args="<args or empty>")

    3. After the skill completes, return a single message with this
       structured block (and nothing else):

       PHASE_RESULT
       phase: <phase_name>
       status: <done | failed | draft>
       artifact_path: <path the skill wrote, or "">
       wedge_sentence: <if set>
       scale_tier: <if set>
       critic_required: <true | false>
       open_issues: <count>
       summary: <≤ 240 chars>

    Do not write code, do not modify files outside what the skill
    writes, do not invoke other skills.
  """,
  model = "<opus | sonnet | haiku>"
)
```

The orchestrator parses `PHASE_RESULT`, updates `state.json` via
`scripts/state-set.sh`, and decides the next edge.

**Parallel fan-out** (Phase 7 implementation): emit multiple `Task`
calls in a single message; they run concurrently. Wait for all to
return before proceeding.

---

## Critic invocation pattern

After phases that produce a strategic artifact (`ceo`,
`differentiation`, `product-spec`, `designer`, `ux-designer`,
`pricing`, `positioning`):

```
Task(
  subagent_type = "general-purpose",
  description   = "Critic gate — <phase>",
  prompt        = """
    You are an adversarial critic. You did NOT write the artifact at
    <path>. Read it now (and only it; plus docs/01c-wedge.md if Phase 2+).

    If the `codex` skill is available, invoke it via:
       Skill(skill="codex", args="review <path>")
    Otherwise, apply the critic checklist for this phase (see below).

    Return:
       CRITIC_VERDICT
       phase: <phase>
       verdict: <pass | fail>
       must_fix: <bullet list of blocking issues>
       nice_to_have: <bullet list>
       evidence_quality: <strong | weak | absent>
  """,
  model = "<a different model than the producer>"
)
```

Critic checklists per phase live in §"Critic checklists" below.

## State file: `state/state.json`

Initialize on first run via `scripts/state-init.sh "<product idea>"`.
Schema (defaults from the script):

```json

## Phase execution

### Phase 0 — Bootstrap (orchestrator runs directly)
```bash
mkdir -p state docs
scripts/state-init.sh "$ARGUMENTS"
git init 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Phase 1 — `ceo`
Spawn a subagent using the template above with:
- skill: `ceo`
- manifest: `(idea only)`
- model: `opus`
- args: `$ARGUMENTS`

On `PHASE_RESULT.status = done` → run critic gate (next phase).

### Phase 1c — `ceo_critic`
Critic spawn against `docs/01-market-analysis.md`, model `sonnet`.
Pass criteria:
- TAM/SAM/SOM cited with sources
- ≥ 5 competitors with pricing or "no public price" called out
- Competitor matrix non-trivial (not just product names)
- Wedge candidates non-empty
- No platitudes ("revolutionary," "next-generation")

Fail → loop to `ceo` with `must_fix` as input.

### Phase 2 — `differentiation`
Subagent template, skill `differentiation`, manifest `[01]`, model `opus`.
On done, the skill writes `01c-wedge.md`. Parse and run:
```bash
scripts/state-set.sh '.wedge_sentence' "\"$WEDGE\""
scripts/state-set.sh '.scale_tier'     "\"$TIER\""
scripts/state-set.sh '.icp'            "\"$ICP\""
scripts/state-set.sh '.axis'           "\"$AXIS\""
scripts/state-set.sh '.anti_axis'      "\"$ANTI\""
```

### Phase 2c — `diff_critic`
Critic spawn, model `sonnet`. Checks:
- Single axis (not "we'll be better at everything")
- Anti-axis non-empty and binding
- Wedge sentence < 140 chars
- Could-copy-in-a-weekend test fails (i.e. non-trivial)

If `verdict = fail` AND `01c-wedge.md` is `Status: DRAFT`, loop to
`differentiation`. If `verdict = fail` AND `LOCKED`, demote to DRAFT
in state and loop.

### Phase 2.5 — Human checkpoint 1
Use `AskUserQuestion` to surface:
- Wedge sentence
- ICP one-liner
- Scale tier
- Active stack constraints (the `true` flags from differentiation Phase 5b)

Options: `confirm | revise | abandon`. **Mandatory.** This is the
single highest-leverage human decision. Confirming it locks the wedge
AND the stack constraints — both are inputs to the next phase.

### Phase 2.7 — `tech-stack-selector` (NEW)
Subagent, skill `tech-stack-selector`, manifest `[01c]`, model `sonnet`.
On done, the skill writes `docs/00-tech-stack.md`. Parse the resolved
contract and persist key fields:
```bash
scripts/state-set.sh '.tech_stack.ci_provider'  "\"$(yq '.ci.provider' docs/00-tech-stack.md)\""
scripts/state-set.sh '.tech_stack.cloud'        "\"$(yq '.cloud.provider' docs/00-tech-stack.md)\""
scripts/state-set.sh '.tech_stack.auth'         "\"$(yq '.auth.default' docs/00-tech-stack.md)\""
scripts/state-set.sh '.tech_stack.ai_heavy'     "$([[ -n \"$(yq '.ai.cost_tracking // empty' docs/00-tech-stack.md)\" ]] && echo true || echo false)"
```

### Phase 2.7c — `stack_critic`
Critic spawn against `docs/00-tech-stack.md`, model `opus` (different
from selector's `sonnet`). Pass criteria:
- Versions pinned to majors (no "latest")
- `not_in_stack` non-empty (≥ 3 retired defaults)
- Every override has a one-line rationale
- All constraint flags from `01c-wedge.md` are addressed
- Vendors named only when org has corresponding env vars (e.g. Buildkite needs `$BK_API_TOKEN`)
- `ci.provider: buildkite` chosen unless explicit reason against (cost-effective default)

Fail → loop to `tech-stack-selector` with `must_fix` as input.

### Phase 3 — `product-spec`
Subagent, skill `product-spec`, manifest `[00, 01, 01c]`, model `sonnet`.
Hard cap: one critical flow + 3 supporting; rest tagged `[V2]`.

### Phase 4 — `analyst`
Subagent, skill `analyst`, manifest `[01, 01b, 01c]`, model `sonnet`.
Every FR tagged `[wedge-critical]`, `[wedge-supporting]`, or
`[Out-of-wedge → V2]`.

### Phase 5 — `designer`
Subagent, skill `designer`, manifest `[01b, 01c, 02]`, model `opus`.
Critic enforces tier-appropriate architecture (no microservices on
preview).

### Phase 6 — `ux-designer`
Subagent, skill `ux-designer`, manifest `[01b, 01c, 03]`, model `sonnet`.
Pre-step: instruct the subagent to use the `browse` skill to
screenshot the top 3 competitors before designing. Critic uses the
`plan-design-review` rubric (≥ 7 across all dimensions).

### Phase 6.5 — Human checkpoint 2
Surface design target before building.

### Phase 6.7 — `auth-engineer` (NEW, sequential before fan-out)
Subagent, skill `auth-engineer`, manifest `[00, 01c, 02, 03]`,
model `sonnet`. Scaffolds auth per `contract.auth.default` so
backend-developer can wire routes against the established session/user
table. Skipped if `contract.auth.default: hand-rolled-jwt` (legacy
path; backend-developer owns it).

### Phase 6.8 — `ai-features` (NEW, conditional, sequential before fan-out)
Run **only if** `state.tech_stack.ai_heavy == true` (set during Phase
2.7). Subagent, skill `ai-features`, manifest `[00, 01c, 02, 03]`,
model `opus` (taste-heavy). Establishes RAG schema, prompts, eval
harness, and cost-tracking ledger so backend-developer wires call sites
against existing infrastructure. If `ai_heavy: false`, skip silently.

### Phase 6.9 — `email-templates` (NEW, conditional, sequential before fan-out)
Run only if `docs/01b-product-spec.md` mentions transactional emails
(verification, password reset, notifications, digests). Detect with:

```bash
grep -iE 'email|verification|password reset|notification|digest' docs/01b-product-spec.md \
  && state.email_needed=true || state.email_needed=false
```

Subagent, skill `email-templates`, manifest `[00, 01b, 02, 03, 03b]`,
model `haiku`. Configures the provider per `contract.email.provider`
(default Resend), generates templates per `contract.email.templates`
(default React Email), so backend-developer can call a working
`sendEmail()` instead of stubbing it. If `email_needed: false`, skip
silently.

### Phase 7 — Implementation fan-out (PARALLEL)
Emit three `Task` calls in **one message**:
- `backend-developer` (sonnet)
- `frontend-developer` (sonnet)
- `db-migrator` (haiku)

Each writes its `phase_status` field. Wait for all three to return.
All three read `docs/00-tech-stack.md` as their first action and refuse
to introduce vendors not in the contract.

### Phase 7.5 — `api-docs` (NEW, sequential after impl join)
Subagent, skill `api-docs`, manifest `[code, 02, 03]`, model `haiku`.
Scans the now-implemented routes, extracts validators and types, and
writes `docs/07-api-reference.md` + `openapi.yaml`. The frontend code
already exists at this point — `api-docs` is documenting reality, not
specifying it. Subsequent `frontend-developer` reruns (e.g. from
`route-failure.sh`) will read this if they need API shapes.

### Phase 7.7 — `e2e-tester` (NEW, sequential before quality gates)
Subagent, skill `e2e-tester`, manifest `[code, 02, 03b]`, model
`sonnet`. Generates a Playwright suite covering the wedge workflow plus
auth, error states, and responsive layouts. Without this, the `e2e`
quality gate has nothing to run.

The skill iterates until all generated tests pass against the local
dev server. If a test fails because a feature is broken (not the
test), routes back via `route-failure.sh --gate e2e --area <path>` to
the appropriate implementer.

### Phase 8 — Quality gates (orchestrator runs directly)
```bash
scripts/quality-gates.sh
```
Exit code = number of failed gates. On any failure:
```bash
OWNER=$(scripts/route-failure.sh --gate <gate> --area <path>)
```
Re-spawn that owner skill with the failing test output as input.
After 3 failed attempts on the same gate, surface to user.

### Phase 9 — `adversarial-tester`
Subagent, skill `adversarial-tester`, manifest `[code, 02, 03]`, model `opus`.
Different model from the implementer to break monoculture. Re-run
quality gates after.

### Phase 10 — `security-auditor`
Subagent, skill `security-auditor`. Tier gate: `preview` → Critical/High
only; `launch+` → full OWASP ASVS.

### Phase 11 — `dogfood` (NEW)
Subagent, skill `dogfood`, manifest `[01c, 03b]`, model `opus`.
The skill returns a verdict. Routing:
- `SHIP` → advance to perf branch
- `POLISH` → loop to `frontend-developer` (one round, capped)
- `LOOP` → loop to `ux-designer` + `frontend-developer`
- `RETHINK` → loop to `designer` (architecture)

### Phase 11.5 — `perf-tester` (NEW, launch+ only)
Run only if `state.scale_tier in {launch, scale}`. Subagent, skill
`perf-tester`, manifest `[code, 02, 03]`, model `sonnet`. Generates k6
load tests against the wedge workflow, scans Prisma queries for N+1
patterns, checks for missing DB indexes, captures bundle-size
baselines, and writes `docs/10-performance-report.md`.

Hard-fail criteria:
- p95 latency on the wedge workflow > 2× the NFR target
- Any N+1 query on a hot path
- Bundle size > 1.5× the prior baseline (from `benchmark` if present)

Failures route back to `backend-developer` (queries / indexes) or
`frontend-developer` (bundle), depending on the issue class.

For `toy` and `preview` tiers, skip — Lighthouse from the quality gate
is sufficient at those scales.

### Phase 11.7 — `reviewer` (NEW, launch+ only)
Run only if `state.scale_tier in {launch, scale}`. Subagent, skill
`reviewer`, manifest `[full repo, 02, 03]`, model `opus` (different
from per-artifact critics — full-repo cross-cutting view). Writes
`docs/05-code-review.md`.

Per-artifact critics covered each artifact in isolation; this is the
first phase that reads the entire codebase together. Looks for:
- Cross-module inconsistency (one module uses transactions, another
  doesn't, for the same kind of write)
- Dead code / unused exports
- Tests missing for entire surfaces (e.g. one route file has 0 tests)
- Security boundary violations the per-route security audit missed
  because they require cross-route context (e.g. tenant isolation
  across endpoints)

Findings are auto-fixed iteratively (read the SKILL.md — it loops on
each issue). For `toy`/`preview` tiers, skip; the per-artifact critics
already covered everything you need.

### Phase 12 — `pricing` + `positioning` (PARALLEL)
Two `Task` calls in one message:
- `pricing` (sonnet, manifest `[01, 01b, 01c]`)
- `positioning` (sonnet, manifest `[01c, 01b, 16]` — runs after `pricing`)

Actually `positioning` reads `16-pricing.md`, so they cannot fully
parallelize. Run `pricing` first, then `positioning`.

### Phase 12.5 — Human checkpoint 3
Surface tiers, prices, trial mechanic, headline. Confirm or revise.

### Phase 13 — `landing-page`
Subagent, skill `landing-page`, manifest `[01c, 03b, 16, 17]`, model `sonnet`.

### Phase 13.5 — `legal-compliance` (NEW, always for any public deploy)
Subagent, skill `legal-compliance`, manifest `[00, 01b, 01c, 02, 03]`,
model `haiku`. Generates privacy policy, terms of service, cookie
consent banner, GDPR data-access/deletion endpoints
(`DELETE /api/auth/account`, `GET /api/auth/export`), and acceptable
use policy.

Hard gate at `regulated: true` or `eu_global_billing: true` — the
phase fails and blocks `preview_ship` if these constraints are set
but the legal pages are missing.

For `toy` tier, skip (no public exposure).

### Phase 14 — Scale-tier branch (orchestrator)
```
case state.scale_tier in
  toy|preview)  goto preview_ship  ;;
  launch|scale) run 15–18, then preview_ship ;;
esac
```

### Phase 15 — `background-jobs` (launch+ only)
Skill gates itself: if no async needs, returns "[Deferred]".

### Phase 16 — `env-manager` + `cicd` (launch+ only, sequential)

### Phase 17 — `deployer` + `observability` (launch+; scale-only deltas inside)
Run both. `deployer` provisions Vercel/Fly for `preview` (already done
in Phase 19 if tier is preview), or Terraform Cloud Run / ECS for
`launch+`. `observability` wires pino + Sentry + provider-native
monitoring (Cloud Monitoring or CloudWatch) per the contract.

Multi-region, read-replicas, and OpenTelemetry tracing are scale-tier
deltas declared inside `deployer` and `observability` SKILL.md — the
orchestrator does not need a separate phase for them.

### Phase 17.5 — `rollback` (NEW, launch+ only)
Subagent, skill `rollback`, manifest `[00, 03, deploy state]`, model
`haiku`. Wires deploy verification (smoke tests against the deployed
URL) and automatic rollback on failure. Captures the current revision
in `/tmp/rollback-target.env` pre-deploy; if smoke tests fail
post-deploy, rolls back to the captured revision via
`gcloud run services update-traffic` (GCP) or
`aws ecs update-service` (AWS).

Updates `.buildkite/scripts/deploy.sh` to invoke verification + auto-revert.
Writes a runbook to `docs/19-rollback-runbook.md`.

### Phase 18 — `production-readiness` (scale only)

### Phase 19 — Preview ship (orchestrator)
Tier-dependent deploy:
- `toy`     → emit run instructions, no deploy
- `preview` → Vercel/Fly preview URL
- `launch+` → `cicd` + `deployer` deploy
Then run a canary check (spawn `qa` subagent against the deployed URL).

### Phase 19.5 — Human checkpoint 4
GO/NO-GO before public exposure.

### Phase 20 — `analytics` + handoff to `signal-iterate`
Instrument the wedge workflow only. Schedule:
```
/schedule signal-iterate weekly

## Critic checklists (used when `/codex` is unavailable)

### `ceo` critic
- [ ] TAM/SAM/SOM each cite a source
- [ ] ≥ 5 competitors with at least 4 columns of detail
- [ ] No platitudes
- [ ] Wedge candidates non-empty

### `differentiation` critic
- [ ] Single axis named (not multi)
- [ ] Anti-axis is binding (it forbids something)
- [ ] Wedge sentence < 140 chars
- [ ] Wedge survives "could a competitor copy in a weekend?"
- [ ] Workflow has ≤ 10 steps with concrete inputs/outputs
- [ ] Stack constraints section present (Phase 5b); each `true` flag justified

### `tech-stack-selector` critic
- [ ] Versions pinned to majors (no "latest")
- [ ] `not_in_stack` non-empty (≥ 3 retired defaults)
- [ ] Every default-override has a one-line rationale
- [ ] All `true` constraints from `01c-wedge.md` translated into overrides
- [ ] No vendor named without org credentials present (e.g. `$BK_API_TOKEN` for Buildkite)
- [ ] `ci.provider: buildkite` chosen unless explicit reason against (cost-effective default)
- [ ] Tier deltas applied (toy ≠ launch in stack shape)

### `product-spec` critic
- [ ] Exactly one critical flow
- [ ] ≤ 3 supporting flows
- [ ] All else `[V2]`-tagged
- [ ] KPIs measurable, not aspirational

### `designer` critic
- [ ] Architecture matches scale tier (preview ≠ microservices)
- [ ] Justification for every "we chose X over Y"
- [ ] Each NFR tied to an architectural decision

### `ux-designer` critic
- [ ] Competitor teardown present (≥ 3 products)
- [ ] Wireframes for every wedge-workflow step
- [ ] WCAG AA contrast on color palette
- [ ] Hero microcopy = wedge sentence (or ≤ 12-word transform)

### `pricing` critic
- [ ] 2 or 3 tiers (not 4+)
- [ ] No "unlimited"
- [ ] Each tier names its upgrade trigger
- [ ] Trial mechanic matches wedge axis

### `positioning` critic
- [ ] Headline ≤ 12 words
- [ ] Competitive frame names a specific alternative
- [ ] Anti-positioning section non-empty
- [ ] Voice axis locked (not "all of the above")

## Failure-routing matrix

| Failure | Route to |
|---|---|
| Critic rejects spec/wedge | last passing producer |
| Quality gate: typecheck/lint | `route-failure.sh --gate <g> --area <path>` |
| Quality gate: mutation | `adversarial-tester` |
| Quality gate: contract | `backend-developer` |
| Quality gate: e2e | `e2e-tester` (test bug) or `frontend-developer`/`backend-developer` (feature bug) |
| Perf hard-fail (p95 > 2× NFR) | `backend-developer` (queries/indexes) |
| Perf hard-fail (bundle > 1.5×) | `frontend-developer` |
| Reviewer finds cross-cutting issue | the responsible implementer (`backend-developer` / `frontend-developer`) |
| Dogfood `LOOP` | `ux-designer` + `frontend-developer` |
| Dogfood `RETHINK` | `designer` |
| Security Critical/High | `backend-developer` (code) or `env-manager` (secrets) |
| Legal-compliance hard-fail (regulated/EU) | `legal-compliance` (rerun) |
| Canary fails | `rollback` auto-reverts; then `cicd` (pipeline), `deployer` (infra), or `frontend-developer` (build) |

After 3 failed attempts on the same phase, **stop and surface to the
user** via `AskUserQuestion`. This is the safety valve.

## Mandatory human-in-the-loop checkpoints

1. **After `differentiation`** — wedge + ICP + tier confirm
2. **After `ux-designer`** — competitive teardown + design target
3. **After `pricing` + `positioning`** — tiers + headline
4. **At preview-ship** — GO/NO-GO before public URL

These are non-skippable in v2. Use `AskUserQuestion`.

---

## Model routing

Pass `model=` to each `Task` call:

| Phases | Model |
|---|---|
| `ceo`, `differentiation`, `designer`, `dogfood`, `adversarial-tester`, `ai-features`, `reviewer` (all need taste/reasoning) | opus |
| `tech-stack-selector`, `product-spec`, `analyst`, `ux-designer`, `auth-engineer`, `backend-developer`, `frontend-developer`, `e2e-tester`, `perf-tester`, `pricing`, `positioning`, `signal-iterate`, `observability`, `iterate` | sonnet |
| `api-docs`, `env-manager`, `email-templates`, `db-migrator`, `cicd`, `legal-compliance`, `rollback` | haiku |

**Critic** always runs on a *different* model from the producer, to
break monoculture.

---

## Prompt-cache strategy

The six "always-read" docs (`00`, `01`, `01b`, `01c`, `02`, `03`) form
a stable prefix from the tech-stack-selector phase onward. `00` (the
tech-stack contract) goes first because every implementation skill
reads it first. List them in the same order in every subagent's
context manifest so the cache hits. Don't interpolate per-phase data
into the middle of that prefix.

---

## Completion

When the state machine reaches `[*]`, print:

```
## Build Complete (v2)

Wedge:           <wedge sentence>
Scale tier:      <tier>
Phases run:      <list, with skipped phases marked>
Loops taken:     <list of (phase, count)>
Critic gates:    <pass/fail counts>
Quality gates:   <which passed, which were waived and why>
Dogfood health:  <final score>
Preview URL:     <or "local-only">
Next steps:      <iterate cadence; what kill switch to watch>
```

Append a one-line entry to `docs/06-iteration-log.md` as iteration 0.

## Design principles

- **Wedge-driven** — every phase reads `01c-wedge.md`; out-of-wedge
  work is auto-tagged `[V2]`.
- **Subagent isolation** — fresh `general-purpose` subagent per phase
  invokes a single skill via `Skill`. No more 200K-token monolithic
  context by Phase 20.
- **Critic gates** — every strategic artifact is reviewed by a
  different-model subagent before advancing.
- **Scale-tier branching** — `preview` is not forced through Terraform.
- **Loops, not waterfall** — failures route back via `route-failure.sh`.
- **Dogfood loop** — real browser walk of the wedge workflow before ship.
- **Human checkpoints** — at the four high-leverage moments.
- **Model routing** — Opus for taste, Sonnet for volume, Haiku for
  mechanical work.
- **Real scripts** — `state-init.sh`, `state-set.sh`, `state-decide.sh`,
  `quality-gates.sh`, `route-failure.sh` are actual files in `scripts/`.

See `docs/00-pipeline-research-and-redesign.md` for the rationale and
remaining backlog.
