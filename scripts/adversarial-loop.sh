# adversarial-loop.sh — loop-until-dry wrapper around the adversarial-tester.
#
# A single adversarial pass (build-product-v2 Phase 9) finds the shallow bugs and
# stops. Comprehensive coverage needs repeated rounds until the attacker comes up
# empty: keep running adversarial-tester until DRY_STOP consecutive rounds add
# zero NEW findings (deduped by issue id across the whole run), or MAX_ROUNDS.
#
# This is the test-side analogue of adversarial-strategy-loop (which loops the
# strategy adversary). Findings accumulate in state.open_issues; this script only
# drives rounds, dedupes, and accounts — the skill does the finding.
#
# Each round:
#   1. Snapshot the set of known issue ids.
#   2. If --agent: spawn `claude -p` to run the adversarial-tester skill, which
#      files new bugs into state.open_issues (tagged [adversarial]) with a
#      repro_test path. Otherwise report current counts and stop (the
#      orchestrator drives the skill via its Task tool).
#   3. Diff issue ids: anything new resets the dry counter; zero new increments it.
#   4. Bump .testing.adversarial_rounds.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/adversarial-loop.sh                 # report-only (counts + plan)
#   scripts/adversarial-loop.sh --agent         # autonomous loop-until-dry
#   scripts/adversarial-loop.sh --agent --max-rounds 6 --dry-stop 2
#
# Exit code: 0 always (advisory); the verify-loop / gates decide pass/fail.

Use the adversarial-tester skill (via the Skill tool) on this repository.

Your job is to BREAK the implementation, not confirm it: boundary values, fuzz,
property-based, concurrency, and authz/IDOR tests. Run the implementer suite green
first, then attack.${FOCUS:+ Focus this round on: ${FOCUS}.}

For every REAL bug you find:
  - Write a committed reproducing test (red-before-green) under tests/adversarial/.
  - File a structured entry into state.open_issues with fields:
      { "id": "AT-<n>", "severity": ..., "surface": ..., "repro_test": "<path>",
        "owner": "<skill>", "status": "open", "tags": ["adversarial"] }
  - Do NOT fix the bug yourself (tester ≠ fixer).

Pin randomness via the FAST_CHECK_SEED / TEST_SEED env vars so failures reproduce.
Place any known-flaky tests under tests/adversarial/quarantine/ instead of deleting them.
